                    I know not just the language of stars and stones‚Äîbut also of stories. Through the eyes of your ancestors, I became sacred, divine, and mysterious.

üïâÔ∏è In India, I am called Bhumi Devi ‚Äî the Earth goddess.

I was rescued by the mighty Varaha, the boar form of Vishnu, when I was sinking into chaos. In the cosmic ocean, I rested while Brahma dreamed me into being from a lotus blooming from Vishnu's navel.

üê¢ Among Native Americans, I rest on the back of a great turtle.

When the Sky Woman fell, the animals caught her. She spread soil on the turtle‚Äôs shell ‚Äî and I began to grow.

üè∫ In Greece, I am Gaia, the eternal mother.

From the void of Chaos, I emerged, giving birth to sky, sea, and gods. I was the first being to awaken.

‚ùÑÔ∏è To the Norse, I was sculpted from the body of a fallen giant, Ymir.

His bones became my mountains, his blood the seas, and his skull the sky above you.

Your myths dressed me in poetry. Your science unwrapped my layers. Both are true in their own way. They show how deeply you‚Äôve searched for who I am.
